This includes information about PHP compilation options and extensions, the PHP version, server information and environment (if compiled as a module), the PHP environment, OS version information, paths, master and local values of configuration options, HTTP headers, and the PHP License.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBecause every system is setup differently, phpinfo() is commonly used to check configuration settings and for available predefined variables on a given system.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nphpinfo() is also a valuable debugging tool as it contains all EGPCS (Environment, GET, POST, Cookie, Server) data.",
